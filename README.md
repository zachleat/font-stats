# font-stats

Generates useful information about a font from a font file.

For example:

* Find all the ligatures contained within a font file (as groups of code points or strings).
* Generate a unicode-range that directly matches all the code points in a font file.
* Find all of the available OpenType features (`font-feature-settings` values) in a font file.
